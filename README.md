# Credit Risk Analysis — Predicting Loan Defaults

**Business Problem**  
A bank needed to minimize financial losses from an increasing number of loan defaults. The goal was to analyze historical data to understand why defaults were happening and to build an automated system to flag high-risk applicants before a loan is approved.

**Solution**
An end-to-end analytical tool was developed, starting from raw, messy data and ending with a predictive model and an interactive Power BI dashboard. This system not only identifies the key drivers of default but also profiles high-risk customers and provides actionable insights for immediate intervention.

**Key facts**
- Portfolio: **₹14.8M** across **290 loans**  
- Observed default rate: **~10%**  
- Top drivers: **Balance, Loan Duration, Principal Amount**  
- Tools: **Power BI, Python (pandas, scikit-learn), Excel**
